Homebrew Tap for php 5.6 & 7.0

## Assumptions
You use a Mac and have MacOS command line tools and homebrew installed and want to use PHP 5.6.x or 7.0.x with homebrew, eventhough they are no longer supported.

## DISCLAIMER
These taps were added here in the state they were in when they were removed from homebrew. I am not planning to maintain them in any way. I just need these versions for some projects I work on. _So, I take no responsibility for any loss or damage, of any kind whatsoever, that is caused through the use of this Github repository._

### PHP 5.6
`brew install garethlawson/homebrew-php/php@5.6`

### PHP 7.0
`brew install garethlawson/homebrew-php/php@7.0`
